<div class="container">
    <p>When it comes to coffee and a cozy spot to enjoy it, Starbucks is a global favorite. But Starbucks is much more than just coffee—it’s an entire experience with a menu filled with delicious beverages and snacks to suit every taste and occasion. Whether you’re a coffee lover, tea enthusiast, or someone looking for a tasty snack, Starbucks has something for you. Let’s dive into the variety you can find on the Starbucks menu.</p>

    <h2>Coffee Classics</h2>
    <p>First up, Starbucks’ iconic coffee lineup. They are known for their handcrafted espresso beverages, ranging from rich, bold shots of espresso to creamy lattes and cappuccinos. If you’re in the mood for something smooth and sweet, a Caramel Macchiato or a Vanilla Latte is perfect. And for those who like their coffee strong, the classic Americano or a straight shot of espresso never disappoints. Plus, with the ability to customize your drink with different types of milk, syrups, and toppings, you can always make it your own.</p>

    <h2>Tea Time</h2>
    <p>But coffee isn’t the only thing <a href="https://starbucksmenuprice.net/">Starbucks</a> is good at. Their tea options are just as popular. You’ll find everything from calming hot teas like their English Breakfast or Green Tea to their refreshing iced teas, such as the Iced Peach Green Tea Lemonade or the Iced Chai Tea Latte. These drinks are perfect for when you want something a little lighter but still packed with flavor.</p>

    <h2>Cold Beverages</h2>
    <p>Now, let's talk about Starbucks' cold beverages. On a hot day, nothing beats their line of cold brews and iced coffees. The Cold Brew is steeped for 20 hours, making it super smooth and less acidic than regular iced coffee. If you're in the mood for something sweet and refreshing, try the Iced White Chocolate Mocha or the ever-popular Frappuccino Blended Beverages. From the classic Coffee Frappuccino to the fun and indulgent Mocha Cookie Crumble or Java Chip Frappuccino, there's a flavor for every mood.</p>

    <h2>Delicious Food Options</h2>
    <p>In addition to drinks, Starbucks also offers a variety of food options that pair perfectly with your beverage. Their bakery items like the buttery croissants, muffins, and bagels are great for a quick bite. For a more filling option, you can try their breakfast sandwiches or protein boxes, which are great for a meal on the go. And let’s not forget about their seasonal treats: pumpkin loaf and the famous holiday cups with delicious drinks like the Peppermint Mocha or Chestnut Praline Latte are must-tries during the colder months.</p>

    <h2>Healthier Choices</h2>
    <p>What makes Starbucks even better is their commitment to offering healthier options as well. You can find a variety of low-calorie drinks, dairy-free alternatives, and sugar-free syrups to suit your dietary needs without compromising on flavor.</p>

    <div class="call-to-action">
        <p>Whether you’re grabbing a coffee on your way to work, enjoying a relaxing afternoon with friends, or just treating yourself to something special, Starbucks has a menu that fits every occasion. With its ever-expanding range of drinks, snacks, and seasonal specials, there’s always something new to discover. Next time you're at Starbucks, try something different from the menu—you might just find your new favorite!</p>
